College description at the time:
My project is about my favorite sports, basketball, football, and soccer. They build charater, teamwork, confidence, and discipline. These are qualities you can use on and off the court.

My webpage colors are blue black and white. I like the bold colors to bring life to my page. The tabs are home, football, basketball, and soccer. You can navigate through the pages.

Home is the first page and tells you a little about me.

Football tells you about the benefits of it and its history.

Basketball tells you about the game and its history.

Soccer tells you about the USA and its history.
